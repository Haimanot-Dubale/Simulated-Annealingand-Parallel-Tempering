# Simulated-Annealing and-Parallel-Tempering

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. if you want to optimize your fuction with simulated annealing optimization techniques you can refer this project.

Parallel tempering in physics and statistics, (also known as replica exchange MCMC sampling), is a simulation method aimed at improving the dynamic properties of Monte Carlo method simulations of physical systems. the optimised technique of simulated annealing with multiple temreture running inparelle with their own instance
